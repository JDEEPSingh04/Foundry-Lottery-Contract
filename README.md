 Random Lottery Contract

1. Users can pay to enter the lottery
2. Using chainlink VRF for random numbers generated

This is a contract written in foundry where you can enter a lottery game with a given entrance fee. Then after a certain conditions are met a winner will be decided on the basis of result prrovided by chainlink VRF.

ChainLink VRF is a oracle network that allows us to interact with the external world in a decentralized way.

I have installed chainlink-brownie-contract to get the Chainlink VRF interface.
devOpsTools is used for getting the most recently deployed contract.

Refer to Makefile for further assistance.
